      Coming from a background in Education and Music Composition, I love leveraging my creativity and insight into learning techniques to design and create software. Learning is what I enjoy the most, and the fast-changing world of new libraries and frameworks for development is an environment I can thrive in. I'm currently looking for a full-time position at a company that has creative and innovative ideas about how to make the world a better place.
